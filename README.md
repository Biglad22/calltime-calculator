## Overview
Sometimes calls end unexpectedly; other times, you might want to use your airtime for multiple calls. This app helps in both scenarios by calculating how much time you would have to talk on a call. Basically an airtime to talktime converter

### The challenge

Users will be able to:

- Use an optimal layout/interface on their device's screen size
- Convert from airtime to talktime (and maybe vice versa?)
